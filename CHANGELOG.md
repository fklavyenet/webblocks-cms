# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.4.0

- Add Users Phase 1 with admin-managed user system including create, edit, delete, active/inactive state, and last login tracking.
- Add Users Phase 1.5 with search, role/status filters, and improved admin UX.
- Add Users Phase 2 with role-based user model using `super_admin`, `site_admin`, and `editor`.
- Add install-level users with site-scoped access via `site_user` assignments.
- Add server-side enforcement of site access across major admin areas.
- Add `super_admin`-only access to system-level features including users, updates, backups, and settings.
- Maintain backward compatibility by keeping `is_admin` as a temporary bridge while transitioning to role-based authorization.

## 0.3.3

- Add Visitor Reports Phase 2 on top of the stable `0.3.x` line so installed CMS sites can receive the update through the normal updater.
- Extend public visitor tracking with sanitized nullable `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, and `utm_campaign` capture, plus optional `CMS_VISITOR_UTM_ENABLED` control.
- Expand `/admin/reports/visitors` with Top Campaigns, Source Breakdown, and Medium Breakdown cards that continue to respect date range, site, and locale filters.
- Add a compact Visitor Summary widget to `/admin` with the last 7 days of page views, unique visitors, and top page context.
- Document the Phase 2 tracking model, campaign reporting behavior, privacy notes, limits, and dashboard summary updates in the Markdown docs.

## 0.3.2

- Promote Visitor Reports V1 release to the 0.3.x line so it becomes visible as the latest stable update.
- No functional changes compared to 0.2.1.

## 0.2.1

- Add Visitor Reports V1 with a compact admin screen at `/admin/reports/visitors`.
- Implement lightweight public visitor tracking backed by the new `visitor_events` table with multisite-aware and locale-aware reporting queries.
- Keep tracking privacy-safe by storing `ip_hash` instead of raw IP addresses and documenting the feature, config, and V1 limits in the README.

## 0.3.1

- Fix release workflow script invocation so release note generation and archive builds run reliably in GitHub Actions even when executable bits are not preserved.
- Include post-merge stabilization after the integrated multisite and site-management release flow.
- Retain the combined multisite, site clone/import, site delete, settings, and sidebar improvements introduced across the 0.3.x line.

## 0.3.0

- Merge the multisite and multilingual foundation into the main line as the base for site-aware admin and public flows.
- Add first-party site clone and export/import workflows for controlled duplication and package-based transfer between installs.
- Add site deletion safeguards, a minimal system settings screen, and reorganized System and Maintenance navigation in the admin sidebar.
- Improve controlled system settings persistence and clarify admin UX across site-management flows.

## 0.2.0

- Ship the first real multisite and multilingual core release with legacy single-site upgrade migrations for existing `0.1.8` installs.
- Preserve default public routing by creating a primary `default` site, seeding `en` as the default locale, backfilling legacy pages and translatable block content, and keeping default-locale URLs prefixless.
- Publish the release through the stable update channel with an explicit `minimum_client_version` of `0.1.8` so installed legacy sites can detect and apply the upgrade through the normal updater.
- Add first-party Export / Import V1 as a portable site package workflow for migration, duplication, and transfer between installs.
- Keep Export / Import explicitly separate from Backup / Restore with dedicated admin screens, package storage, package validation, audit tables, and artisan commands.
- Support site package export/import for site records, locale assignments, pages, page translations, page slots, blocks, block translations, navigation, and optional media/assets with safe archive validation and ID remapping on import.
